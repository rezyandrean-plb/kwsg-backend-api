        <img src="https://kwsingapore.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/news.jpg" alt="The Real Estate Model of the Future. Built Today." style="width:100%;max-width:600px;margin:24px auto;display:block;" />
        <p>Keller Williams (KW) has officially entered Singapore's real estate market, launching with a seed valuation of S$10 million and a business model that promises to reshape how property consultants work, earn and grow.</p>
        <p>The new agency—spearheaded by PropertyLimBrothers co-founder Melvin Lim—marks the local debut of the Keller Williams Worldwide franchise. But unlike traditional agencies, KW Singapore is betting big on a platform-driven model that offers agents higher commission retention, integrated tech tools and professional development.</p>
        <p>In a significant departure from legacy practices, KW Singapore's consultants can retain up to 94 per cent of their commissions. The firm also equips agents with in-house media support, AI-driven client prospecting, and a modular training curriculum via its KW Training Academy.</p>

          "The real estate model in Singapore is due for innovation and forward-looking change. Realtors are often treated as extensions of the agency, rather than independent professionals with the potential to build something of their own," said Melvin Lim, Operating Principal of KW Singapore.<br><br>
          "KW Singapore is structured to change that. We provide the tools, frameworks, platform and education for consultants to scale their business, while building true passive income through the Growth Share Programme."

        <h3 id="heading-1">Riding the wave of digital transformation</h3>
        <p>KW Singapore's entry comes as the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA) pushes for greater digital enablement and flexible infrastructure in the property sector. The agency's tech-forward strategy aims to meet that demand head-on.</p>
        <h3 id="heading-2">Riding the wave of digital transformation</h3>
        <p>According to KW Worldwide president William E. Soteroff, Lim's leadership and the local team's track record made the franchise's expansion into Singapore a natural next step.</p>
        <blockquote style="margin: 16px 0; padding: 12px 20px; background: #222; border-left: 4px solid #B40101; color: #fff; font-style: italic;">
          "Melvin Lim and his team bring a proven track record of innovation, leadership, and success in the Singaporean real estate market," said Soteroff. "Their dedication to education, client service, and cutting-edge media make them an ideal partner to lead our growth in Singapore."
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="heading-3">Responding to the rise of content-first marketing</h3>
        <p>The launch also responds to a notable trend in Singapore's real estate scene: the surge in content marketing by realtors using platforms like TikTok and YouTube to reach younger, digital-first audiences.</p>
        <p>To support this, KW Singapore has developed an in-house Media-as-a-Service capability that offers realtors curated photography, video production, performance marketing services, and AI-powered content creation and distribution.</p>
        <p>While PropertyLimBrothers (PLB) will continue operating as a client-facing media-centric consultancy, KW Singapore is positioned as a separate, consultant-first business. The focus: to help realtors scale their brand, build passive income, and expand their teams through revenue-sharing structures.</p>
        <h3 id="heading-4">Training for a new generation of realtors</h3>
        <p>KW Singapore is also doubling down on training. Its KW Training Academy is designed to upskill both new and experienced consultants in technical areas such as pricing comparison, project benchmarking, and transaction advisory—especially for new launch developments.</p>
        <p>Training is delivered through a blend of in-person and online formats, aimed at supporting consultants with data-led decision-making tools.</p>
        <p>The firm plans to grow its realtor base to 500 by the end of 2025, targeting professionals looking to build their own brand while leveraging KW's support ecosystem.</p>

      <div class="article-content">
        <p><strong>Keller Williams Singapore</strong> has entered the Singapore property market with a seed valuation of SGD $10 million, unveiling a platform-based business model for real estate consultants.</p>
        <p>The agency is led by Melvin Lim, Co-Founder of PropertyLimBrothers, and operates as part of the Keller Williams Worldwide franchise. The new company will focus on enabling realtors to operate with greater independence and efficiency, in line with updated digitalisation targets for the sector and Singapore's broader Smart Nation ambitions.</p>

        <h3 id="heading-0">Consultant-focused model</h3>
        <p>Keller Williams Singapore introduces a structure that allows realtors to retain up to 94% of their commissions. The business model is built upon providing agents with access to in-house media production resources, AI-driven client prospecting technology, and ongoing skills development through the KW Training Academy.</p>
        <p>In discussing the agency's mission and approach, Melvin Lim, Operating Principal of KW Singapore, said:</p>
        <blockquote style="margin: 16px 0; padding: 12px 20px; background: #222; border-left: 4px solid #B40101; color: #fff; font-style: italic;">
          "The real estate model in Singapore is due for innovation and forward-looking change. Realtors are often treated as extensions of the agency, rather than independent professionals with the potential to build something of their own," said Melvin Lim, Operating Principal of KW Singapore. "KW Singapore is structured to change that. We provide the tools, frameworks, platform and education for consultants to scale their business, while building true passive income through the Growth Share Programme," he said.
        </blockquote>

        <p>The new agency's framework addresses recent recommendations by the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA), whose Real Estate Industry Transformation Map has emphasised the importance of empowering agents with digital tools and professional training. This approach aligns with shifting expectations in the property sector as both realtors and clients increasingly turn to digital channels and content platforms.</p>

        <h3 id="heading-1">Support from Keller Williams Worldwide</h3>
        <p>William E. Soteroff, President of Keller Williams Worldwide, acknowledged the appointment of Melvin Lim and his team to lead the brand's expansion in Singapore. He stated:</p>
        <blockquote style="margin: 16px 0; padding: 12px 20px; background: #222; border-left: 4px solid #B40101; color: #fff; font-style: italic;">
          "Melvin Lim and his team brings a proven track record of innovation, leadership, and success in the Singaporean real estate market. Their dedication to education, client service, and cutting-edge media make them an ideal partner to lead our growth in Singapore. We are thrilled to welcome them to the Keller Williams family."
        </blockquote>

        <h3 id="heading-2">Media as a service and technology integration</h3>
        <p>The firm is responding to new consumer habits by investing in media production and marketing support for realtors. As highlighted in a recent CNA article, more agents are engaging clients through TikTok, YouTube and other digital channels to connect with younger, digitally native property buyers. KW Singapore's Media-as-a-Service provision includes on-site media studios, curated vendors for property marketing, and AI tools to enhance content creation and distribution efforts.</p>
        <p>Additionally, KW Training Academy aims to build technical competency among consultants, equipping new agents with data-driven frameworks for advising on new property developments. The agency is placing particular emphasis on training in areas such as pricing comparisons, project benchmarking and bespoke buyer and seller consultations, with delivery through both online and in-person formats.</p>

        <h3 id="heading-3">Autonomy for agents</h3>
        <p>KW Singapore operates independently from PropertyLimBrothers, which continues to function as a client-facing real estate consultancy. KW Singapore's platform is designed for consultants seeking autonomy, diversified income streams, and opportunities to recruit and mentor teams. Agents who bring in additional consultants benefit from an ongoing revenue-sharing model, incorporating sustained earning potential through team-building.</p>

        <h3 id="heading-4">Growth plans</h3>
        <p>The company has set a target to expand its base to 500 realtors by the end of 2025, focusing on individuals and teams interested in brand building, professional development, and higher commission rates through the agency's scalable structure. KW Singapore is prioritising the new launch segment for the next two years as part of its market strategy, offering added value to both property consumers and developers through enhanced technical advisory services.</p>
