# Projects Banner URL Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the `image_url_banner` field in the projects table using data from the `banner_url.csv` file. The update process matched projects by their names and updated the banner URLs accordingly.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `update-projects-banner-urls.js`
- **Purpose**: Main script to update banner URLs in the projects table
- **Features**:
  - Reads banner URLs from CSV file
  - Matches projects by name (exact and case-insensitive)
  - Updates the `image_url_banner` field in the database
  - Provides detailed logging and error handling
  - Generates summary report

### 2. `run-projects-banner-update.sh`
- **Purpose**: Shell script wrapper for easy execution
- **Features**:
  - Checks prerequisites (Node.js, npm packages, CSV file)
  - Provides colored output for better readability
  - Error handling and validation

## Update Results

### Summary Statistics
- **Total projects in CSV**: 349
- **Successfully updated**: 348 (99.7%)
- **Not found in database**: 1 (0.3%)

### Project Not Found
- **Penrith**: This project exists in the CSV but was not found in the database

### Success Rate
The update process achieved a **99.7% success rate**, with only one project not being found in the database. This indicates excellent data matching between the CSV file and the existing projects table.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
- **Table**: `projects`
- **Field Updated**: `image_url_banner` (string, nullable)
- **Matching Fields**: `name` and `project_name`

### Matching Logic
1. **Exact Match**: First tries to match by exact project name
2. **Case-Insensitive Match**: If exact match fails, tries case-insensitive matching
3. **Multiple Fields**: Checks both `name` and `project_name` fields

### CSV Structure
The CSV file contains the following columns:
- `projectName`: Project name for matching
- `projectId`: Project identifier (not used for matching)
- `image_banner_url`: Banner image URL to be inserted

## Usage

### Running the Update Script
```bash
# Using the shell script (recommended)
./run-projects-banner-update.sh

# Or directly with Node.js
node update-projects-banner-urls.js banner_url.csv
```

### Custom CSV File
```bash
./run-projects-banner-update.sh path/to/your/csv/file.csv
```

## Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling:
- **File Validation**: Checks if CSV file exists
- **Database Connection**: Validates database connectivity
- **Individual Project Errors**: Continues processing even if individual projects fail
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides timestamps and status for each operation

## Dependencies

- **Node.js**: Required for script execution
- **knex**: Database query builder
- **csv-parser**: CSV file parsing
- **PostgreSQL**: Database system

## Future Considerations

1. **Data Validation**: Consider adding URL validation for banner images
2. **Backup Strategy**: Create database backups before bulk updates
3. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for banner image accessibility
4. **Performance**: For larger datasets, consider batch processing

## Conclusion

The banner URL update process was highly successful, updating 348 out of 349 projects (99.7% success rate). The single unmatched project ("Penrith") may need manual investigation to determine if it should be added to the database or if there's a naming discrepancy.

The scripts created are reusable and can be used for future banner URL updates or similar data import operations.
